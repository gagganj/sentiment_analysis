In recent years, deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied to text sentiment analysis with comparatively remarkable results. In this paper, we describe a jointed CNN and RNN architecture, taking advantage of the coarse-grained local features generated by CNN and long-distance dependencies learned via RNN for sentiment analysis of short texts. Experimental results show an obvious improvement upon the state-of-the-art on three benchmark corpora, MR, SST1 and SST2, with 82.28{\%}, 51.50{\%} and 89.95{\%} accuracy, respectively.",

abstract="Sentiment analysis of film reviews is the basis of obtaining the opinions of movie viewers. It has an important influence on movie public opinion control and stimulating potential viewers. Due to the natural openness and randomness of social media, there may exist a considerable amount of useless or false information in film review comments, making it challenging to analyze the credibility of the comments. This paper proposes a fine-grained sentiment analysis method based on the key-viewpoint sentences of Chinese film reviews, where a deep learning model is used to classify the fine-grained emotions in film reviews. Based on the analysis results, a method for calculating the credibility of review comments is proposed. Under the credibility criteria, corpus screened through credibility filtering algorithm, the overall sentiment classification can obtain 9{\%} improvement on accuracy than the original corpus, which verifies the validity of the credibility algorithm. The higher quality corpus achieved by the credibility algorithm is benefit for improving the accuracy of the sentiment classification.",

abstract = {This research presents an enhanced approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) of Hotels’ Arabic reviews using supervised machine learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art research of training a set of classifiers with morphological, syntactic, and semantic features to address the research tasks namely: (a) T1:Aspect Category Identification, (b) T2:Opinion Target Expression (OTE) Extraction, and (c) T3: Sentiment Polarity Identification. Employed classifiers include Naïve Bayes, Bayes Networks, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and Support-Vector Machine (SVM).The approach was evaluated using a reference dataset based on Semantic Evaluation 2016 workshop (SemEval-2016: Task-5). Results show that the supervised learning approach outperforms related work evaluated using the same dataset. More precisely, evaluation results show that all classifiers in the proposed approach outperform the baseline approach, and the overall enhancement for the best performing classifier (SVM) is around 53% for T1, around 59% for T2, and around 19% in T3.}
